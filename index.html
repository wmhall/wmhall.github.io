		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p id="instructions">
			1. Click on the appropriate download link and install the correct version for your phone.<br>	
			2. Launch the app. <br>
			3. Enter your participant number. This will be in the email the researchers send you.<br>
			4. Enter the times that you wake up and have dinner for weekdays and weekends. You will be asked to enter hours separately from the minutes. Please see the example below. <br>
			5. Exit out of the app. Then re-launch the app. This will send your data to the researchers.<br>
			6. Email the researchers to let them know you have re-installed the app and have re-launched it, so they can check to see if they have received your data.</p>
			<p id="example"><strong>Example</strong>:<br> On weekdays, you wake up at <strong>8:00AM</strong> and eat dinner at <strong>6:30PM</strong>.<br> 
			On weekends, you up at <strong>10:10AM</strong> and eat dinner at <strong>7:15PM</strong>.<br><br>
			You would enter the following information into the screens:<br>
			Weekday Wake Hour: <strong>8</strong><br>
			Weekday Wake Minutes: <strong>00</strong><br>
			Weekday Dinner Hour: <strong>18</strong><br>
			Weekday Dinner Minutes: <strong>30</strong><br> 
			Weekend Wake Hour: <strong>10</strong><br>
			Weekend Wake Minutes: <strong>10</strong><br>
			Weekend Dinner Hour: <strong>19</strong><br>
			Weekend Dinner Minutes: <strong>15</strong><br></p>
		<p id="warning">For the iOS version, each time you exit the app, there will be a pop-up dialog asking you to turn on location services that will disappear before you can answer it. Please just ignore it. <br>
		Alternatively, you agree to enable location services on for the app, and then turn off location services completely after doing this. This tends to make the pop-dialog disappear completely. </p> -->
		<p id="email">If you have any questions or are still having problems, please email the <a href="mailto:will.hall@utoronto.ca">researchers.</a><br></p>
